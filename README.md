The tensorflow-ocaml project provides some [OCaml](http://ocaml.org) bindings for [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org).

These bindings are in a very early stage of their development and are not ready for real-world usage. Expect some segfaults if you use them.

## Installation

* Install the dependencies.
`opam install ocamlbuild ctypes ctypes-foreign`
You may also have to install the python-dev package.
* Clone the repo.
`git clone https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml.git`
* Install [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org).
* Copy the TensorFlow shared library to `lib/libtensorflow.so` in the cloned repo. The following command may work.
`cp ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow.so lib/libtensorflow.so`
* Try executing the examples from the root of the cloned repo.
`make run`

## Examples

* `examples/load.ml` contains a simple example where the TensorFlow graph is loaded from a file (this graph has been generated by `examples/load.py`).
* `examples/simple.ml` and `examples/var.ml` show how to generate a TensorFlow graph from OCaml and execute it.

## Dependencies

* [ocaml-ctypes](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes) is used for the C bindings.
* [Core](https://github.com/janestreet/core) is only necessary for the operator code generation.
* The code in the piqi directory comes from the [Piqi project](http://piqi.org). There is no need to install piqi though.
