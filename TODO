- Ops Generation.
  - Handle number_attr in the code generator.
  - Switch to ocaml-protoc ?

- Proper wrapper around wrapper.ml.
  - More functional and type-safe api.
  - Store in [Session.t] the current nodes and automatically extend the graph on [Session.run].
    - Remove [Session.extend_graph].
  - Tensor wrapper.
    - Use bigarray rather than carray.
    - Pretty-printer for tensors.
    - Getter, accessor, initialization (store the dims in [Tensor.t]).
    - Only create a C tensor when calling [Session.run], store it in a hashtable until [Session.run] has completed.
      the same [CArray] or [Bigarray].

- Safer/better impls for ops.
  - Variable initialization.
    - Force variables to have an initialization in [Ops_m.var{f,d}], init could be zero/const/..., maybe a tensor ?
    - Store the initialization details somewhere.
    - When calling [Session.run], we go through the graph to upload new nodes, also get new var nodes
      and call [Session.run] a first time to perform initialization.
  - Add simple functions for const/scalar/arithmetic operations.

- Gradient Computation and Descent.
  - Register the gradients of more functions.
  - Bugfix: do not call [is_useful] recursively on children where [registered_gradients] returned None.

- Examples and tests.
  - Example with gradient descent, e.g. linear regression.
